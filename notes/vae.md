# STAGE1: Autoencoder

Training on your own dataset can be beneficial to get better tokens and hence better images for your domain.
Those are the steps to follow to make this work:
1. install the repo with `conda env create -f environment.yaml`, `conda activate sd` and `pip install -e .`
1. put your .jpg files in a folder `your_folder`
2. create 2 text files a `xx_train.txt` and `xx_test.txt` that point to the files in your training and test set respectively (for example `find $(pwd)/your_folder -name "*.jpg" > train.txt`)
3. adapt `configs/custom_vqgan.yaml` to point to these 2 files
4. run `python main.py --base configs/custom_vqgan.yaml -t True --gpus 0,1` to
   train on two GPUs. Use `--gpus 0,` (with a trailing comma) to train on a single GPU.

### Data preparation

### Faces 
For downloading the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets, proceed as described in the [taming-transformers](https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers#celeba-hq) 
repository.

### LSUN 

The LSUN datasets can be conveniently downloaded via the script available [here](https://github.com/fyu/lsun).
We performed a custom split into training and validation images, and provide the corresponding filenames
at [https://ommer-lab.com/files/lsun.zip](https://ommer-lab.com/files/lsun.zip). 
After downloading, extract them to `./data/lsun`. The beds/cats/churches subsets should
also be placed/symlinked at `./data/lsun/bedrooms`/`./data/lsun/cats`/`./data/lsun/churches`, respectively.

### ImageNet
The code will try to download (through [Academic
Torrents](http://academictorrents.com/)) and prepare ImageNet the first time it
is used. However, since ImageNet is quite large, this requires a lot of disk
space and time. If you already have ImageNet on your disk, you can speed things
up by putting the data into
`${XDG_CACHE}/autoencoders/data/ILSVRC2012_{split}/data/` (which defaults to
`~/.cache/autoencoders/data/ILSVRC2012_{split}/data/`), where `{split}` is one
of `train`/`validation`. It should have the following structure:

```
${XDG_CACHE}/autoencoders/data/ILSVRC2012_{split}/data/
├── n01440764
│   ├── n01440764_10026.JPEG
│   ├── n01440764_10027.JPEG
│   ├── ...
├── n01443537
│   ├── n01443537_10007.JPEG
│   ├── n01443537_10014.JPEG
│   ├── ...
├── ...
```

If you haven't extracted the data, you can also place
`ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar`/`ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar` (or symlinks to them) into
`${XDG_CACHE}/autoencoders/data/ILSVRC2012_train/` /
`${XDG_CACHE}/autoencoders/data/ILSVRC2012_validation/`, which will then be
extracted into above structure without downloading it again.  Note that this
will only happen if neither a folder
`${XDG_CACHE}/autoencoders/data/ILSVRC2012_{split}/data/` nor a file
`${XDG_CACHE}/autoencoders/data/ILSVRC2012_{split}/.ready` exist. Remove them
if you want to force running the dataset preparation again.


## Model Training

Logs and checkpoints for trained models are saved to `logs/<START_DATE_AND_TIME>_<config_spec>`.

### Training autoencoder models

Configs for training a KL-regularized autoencoder on ImageNet are provided at `configs/autoencoder`.
Training can be started by running
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<GPU_ID> python main.py --base configs/autoencoder/<config_spec>.yaml -t --gpus 0,    
```
where `config_spec` is one of {`autoencoder_kl_8x8x64`(f=32, d=64), `autoencoder_kl_16x16x16`(f=16, d=16), 
`autoencoder_kl_32x32x4`(f=8, d=4), `autoencoder_kl_64x64x3`(f=4, d=3)}.

For training VQ-regularized models, see the [taming-transformers](https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers) 
repository.
